We want to do some analysis of the average order value (AOV). When we look at orders data over a 30 day window, we naively calculate an AOV of $3145.13. Given that we know these shops are selling sneakers, a relatively affordable item, something seems wrong with our analysis. \n\n**a. Think about what could be going wrong with our calculation.

I'm guessing it is probably from the mean as high values of order amounts will drag this number up. Using panda's handy `describe()` method on the data frame, we can see that the mean order amount is indeed 3,145.13. Also, there is an incredibly large standard deviation of 41282.54. This means that on average, the values vary 41,282.54 from the mean, making the mean not a very useful representation of the AOV!\n\nThe `describe()` function we used also gave us some valuable information to better understand this data aside from the mean and standard deviation.  We can see the minimum value is 90 and max value is 704,000. We can also see the values for the median and first and third quartile. Comparing these numbers, we can see that the maximum value is much higher than the other values. Considering our dataset has 5000 records, there are probably a few outlier values that are incredibly high dragging up the mean.\n\nTo get a sense of the distribution, we can look at a box plot of the data.","metadata":{"_uuid":"9360fec011211a913e23e61a561c66aaf2a9e441"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df.boxplot(column='order_amount')","metadata":{"_uuid":"ee45d7f21e47726986dd57e7f296029ddd46c42d","trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The entire box portion of the box plot is a line along 0!

What product was ordered the most by customers in Germany?**\n\nThe data we need to solve this problem is scattered across a few different tables. Our final query should show a list of products ordered by customers in Germay and how many orders of that product there were.\n\nWe can break down the problem into smaller sections and tackle them one at a time. First, let's look at *all orders from Germany*.\n\n```\nSELECT [Orders].OrderID,\n\t[Customers].Country\nFROM [Orders]\nJOIN [Customers]\n\tON [Customers].CustomerID = [Orders].CustomerID\nWHERE [Customers].Country = 'Germany'\n```\nThis gives us a list of all orders to customers in Germany.\n\nThe next part of the problem is figuring out *which item was ordered the most*. We need to incorporate information such as product ID and quantity from the `[OrderDetails]` table to do this. By joining `[OrderDetails]` through the `OrderID` column, we can find the total quantity for each product by summing the quantity column and grouping by product id. \n\n```\nSELECT [Customers].Country,\n\t[OrderDetails].ProductID,\n    SUM([OrderDetails].Quantity) AS \"TotalOrdered\"\nFROM [Orders]\nJOIN [Customers]\n\tON [Customers].CustomerID = [Orders].CustomerID\nJOIN [OrderDetails]\n\tON [OrderDetails].OrderID = [Orders].OrderID\nWHERE [Customers].Country = 'Germany'\nGROUP BY [OrderDetails].ProductID\nORDER BY TotalOrdered DESC -- Show most ordered item at the top.\n```\n\nAt this point, we can see the most ordered item has a product ID of 40 at 160 orders. To make sense of this result, we can join the `[Products]` table on the `ProductID` column to get the name of the most ordered product.\n\n```\nSELECT [Products].ProductName,\n    SUM([OrderDetails].Quantity) AS \"TotalOrdered\"\nFROM [Orders]\nJOIN [Customers]\n\tON [Customers].CustomerID = [Orders].CustomerID\nJOIN [OrderDetails]\n\tON [OrderDetails].OrderID = [Orders].OrderID\nJOIN [Products]\n\tON [Products].ProductID = [OrderDetails].ProductID\nWHERE [Customers].Country = 'Germany'\nGROUP BY [OrderDetails].ProductID\nORDER BY TotalOrdered DESC -- Show most ordered item at the top.\n```\n\nThis final query shows that **Boston Crab Meat** has the most orders at **160 total orders**.\n","metadata":{"_uuid":"1dbe3fd9364b6049b1ee1021359b0381d9b6a56e"}}]}
